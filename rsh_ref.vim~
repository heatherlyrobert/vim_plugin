""===[[ PURPOSE ]]=============================================================#

"   rsh_ref is an integrated set of refactoring services to make a painful,
"   repetitive, lengthy, tedious, haphazard, and scary process into a clear,
"   reliable, consistent, automated, and smooth one.  why allow such a critical
"   and repetitive activity to be manual and keep a programmer from making
"   necessary improvements and potentially break programs?
"
"   refactoring was originally codified with based on the experience that most
"   improvements and changes to a program fall into a limited set of specific,
"   definable transformations to the code.
"
"
"   PRINCIPLE > write programs that do one thing well and do it well
"
