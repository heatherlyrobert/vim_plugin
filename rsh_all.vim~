""===[[ PURPOSE ]]=============================================================#

"   rsh_all is a shared set of functions used by most or all of the vim-ide

"   really careful attention

""===[[ EXTERNAL INTERFACE ]]==================================================#

"   principle   -- keep the external interface small, flexible, and clean
"
"   key mapping -- only ",g" is externally visible to call up the window
